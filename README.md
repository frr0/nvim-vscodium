# nvim-vscodium

This project aims to recreate my nvim enviroment in vscode (VSCodium).

## General

This is a mouseless config of vscode, based on `Vim` keybindings and the `Which Key` plugin called by `Space` .

## Install

Clone this repo in `~/.config`.

## Config

`nvim` has to be installed (v 0.5+),

Copy `keybindings.json` and `settings.json` in `~/.config/VSCodium/User`,

Install these plugins: `VSCode Neovim`, `Which Key`, `Git Extension Pack` and `Error Lens`.
